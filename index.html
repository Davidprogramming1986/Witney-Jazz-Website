                                <p> <a href='http://www.robterrytrio.com'>Rob</a> and his trio have taken Mr Gershwin's jazz AND classical compositions and re-arranged them for piano, double bass and drums - the result is extraordinary! Combining a familiar  jazz standards repertoire with western classical music in a way that truly works - Rob Terry's music features melody and gripping dynamics, beautifully played. Their performances simply 'drip' with virtuosity, yet this is no pompous 'conceptual' band playing self indulgent originals. Rob, Paul and Charlie are definitely out to entertain. There are self penned pieces, but these are imbued with a sense of familiarity that renders them truly engaging. A delight........</p>

                                <p>This man Henderson is truly a remarkable musician. One time ‘Royal’ trumpeter, he's created an enviable reputation for himself in the UK as a performer of the highest calibre, jazz educator and composer. It's easy to draw comparisons with the greats, but Stuart's can be pitched somewhere between the warm joyous tones of Chet Baker and the hard Bop of Lee Morgan. Stylistically you cannot pigeon hole Mr Henderson, for Witney Jazz he'll be playing a selection of delicious, well known standards with a distinctly funky edge. On hand to assist with creating that all important rhythm will be hard hitting guitarist Hugh Turner, powerhouse bassist Paul Jefferies and a drummer of distinction - Simon Price.</p>

SO, we’re delighted to bring him back but this time with pianist Rob Terry and guitarist Jez Cook and bassist Paul Jefferies to create some really new sounding jazz which celebrates this festive time of year. There’ll be nods to the classical world, beautiful arrangements of well known carols, christmassy jazz standards and a smattering of originals from Ben and Rob for you to get your teeth into.  </p>

Welcome - sadly not - the iconic figure (Oscar) himself, but a very worthy emulator in the more svelte shape of celebrated London based pianist Tom Pilling with Paul Jefferies sitting in for the great Ray Brown and ace midlands based drummer Nick Millward working the Ed Thigpen kit. There will be shed loads of swing; there will be shockingly good ballads and these three maestros will play through two sets of truly inspiring tunes - pieces that Oscar's Trio became famous for.</p>

                                <p>Trying to squeeze in here even a snapshot of Tina’s career and the accolades that follow her performances is tough! She’s performed and often recorded with just about everyone on the British, US and Euro scenes who is anyone, but we can tell you that her voice is utterly captivating - as is her presence and charisma on stage. Pin-point accurate pitch, immaculate phrasing and a vocal sound that’s both rich and smooth but with a hint of huskiness. So expect some scintillating jazz from Tina and a rather tight rhythm section of Rob Terry (piano), Paul jefferies (bass) and Charlie Stratford (drums). </p>

                                <p> <a href='http://www.catherinesykes.com'>Catherine</a> hails from north Yorkshire. She’s a graduate of Leeds College of Music and she has the most wonderful vocal instrument which is smooth and full bodied but with a hint of huskiness. She’s performed at a host of the top clubs around the UK, most often in the company of top rate big bands (Pasadena Roof Orchestra, Glen Miller Memorial Orchestra, Nick Ross Orchestra), but she does occasionally agree to perform in a small ensemble and we’ve asked her to bring her Peggy Lee Tribute show to Witney Jazz with an intimate chamber styled piano and double bass trio. So lots of work for all three to undertake but a great opportunity to express themselves and really delve deep into these fabulous tunes. </p>

                                <p>For Mr Spillett read Mr Tubby Hayes! Simon is possibly the world's leading expert on the British hard bop Saxophone phenomenon who took America by storm in the 50s. His concerts are unashamedly full of the music of Tubby and references to his works. With a fiery turn of speed, tough talking tone and lyricism aplenty, Simon Spillett is the sax players player. With Alex Steele (piano), Paul Jefferies (bass) and Charlie Stratford (drums) this promises to be one of the highlights of our 2017 series!</p>

This unique quartet revolutionised jazz at the time and Witney Jazz, ever keen to keep things interesting and moving on, are delighted to welcome Ben on trumpet and flugel horn. Joining him will be award winning saxophonist Amy Roberts, drummer Nick Millward and Paul Jefferies on double bass for a night of West Coast ‘Cool’.  The original band only played a handful of gigs in the Hague, Holland but this piano-less quartet pioneered a whole new sound that has rarely been emulated. </p>

                                <p>Mr Ilett is one heck of guitarist, but more recently he’s taken to adding a good deal of vocals to his sets. Take a peek at his <a href='http://www.promusictutor.com/blog/an-interview-with-denny-ilett/'>interview video</a> and see how broad his influences are. A professional for nearly 30 years, band leader, composer and master arranger, Denny Jnr. (his father Denny Snr. is a superb trumpeter) has toured the world performing with or directing for a host of stunning ensembles including the much loved Lilian Boute band. His voice just lends itself to Sinatra comparisons and so we’ve asked Denny to bring along a quartet of his favourite musicians to create a night of vocal and guitar led music. </p>

                                <p>This globe trotting musician is on the road over 250 days of the year, yet his playing spark never seems to dim. He just adores performing and his astonishing energy is evident from the first few bars of every concert. Phil began playing as a teenager and attended the world famous Berklee School of Music. Shortly after he joined the Ray Charles Orchestra, touring with the great man for two years and then moving onto Artie Shaw’s band. The Chicago Tribune’s Howard Reich perhaps puts it best when he says of Greg <em>"Abate is not content to rely on stock bebop riffs and standard chord progressions. Rather, the sharp angularity of his phrases and the often startling pauses in his fast-moving lines give his work a feeling of constant invention and creativity.” </em> See what you think - we think he’s a ‘monster’. </p>

                                <p>Jamie teams up with jazz violinist Ben Holder and stunning pianist Tom Kincaid to create a musical tribute to the music of Benny Goodman. yes - we hear you “but Benny was a band leading clarinettist” true, but that’s what makes it much more fun. These guys are not setting out to emulate or copy the great reeds player but they do adore his music and they will take it by the scruff of the neck and create something truly effervescent with it, that much we can promise. Tom Kincaid is a Manchester based pianist who specialises in the older, perhaps less chromatic piano approach with rhythm being its prime element, yet he has a touch that’s at once feather light and yet truly muscular - the closest thing you’ll come to hearing Teddy Wilson live!</p>
